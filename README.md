# Cube Wireframe Animation

Tiny demo that draws and rotates a wireframe cube on a 2D canvas.

## Run
- Open index.html in a browser; the cube should rotate automatically.
- If the canvas is blank, ensure the script runs after the canvas tag (add `defer` to the script or move it to the end of body).
